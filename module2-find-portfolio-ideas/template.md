## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

Board games

1. Geographic Variation
Where are board games being designed per captia vs. Where are games being bought per capita. 


2. Trend related to the news
TTRPG's like D&D seem to be growing in popularity, I suspect maybe because being nerdy is more mainstream.
Is there any link between the growth of the tech industry and Board games?


3. Who does that?
In D&D there is still a sense it is mostly played by adult white males. Is that true?


4. Answering a question people care about
Do people who own/play a lot of board games tend to spend more time with their kids?


5. Valuable to businesses
What kinds of games sell well? Ones with good art, good world-building (or a good/convincing premise I guess), or ones with a specific board game type (is it a deck-builder, resource management, co-op vs. competetive, etc.). What kind of board games tend to sell expansions?


6. What's the most popular?
Why on earth is Monopoly and Risk still popular even though they are terribly designed?


7. Cost/Money rankings
How much does it cost to make a board game? Does it vary by type? Or is there some other variable
Average price asks for kickstarter backed boardgames.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
It takes a certain kind of nerdy/math inclined mentality to enjoy board games


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://quanticfoundry.com/2017/04/27/board-gaming-motivations/
It's a few simple findings, but they are fun and interesting

hypothesis: Men are more competitive at board games.
question: Why do people play board games?
topic: Board game players
style: Informational, with a hint of "Ooh, look at that, bet ya didn't see that coming, did ya?"

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
What percentage of people play for "social interaction" play with friends vs. family? Are board games more a "friends" thing than "family" thing?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What board games do we play? Do we prefer certain combination of games, i.e do we prefer certain mechanics to have certain settings?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Video games, there are a lot of misconceptions about who plays those and why.

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

General Science knowledge of a populace
Can you apply the templates to your topics? 


1. Geographic Variation
Of first world countries, which country's populace is most scientifically versed per capita?
How many of them move to other places?

2. Trend related to the news
USA's rankings in math and science are decreasing. Why?


3. Who does that?
"When will I ever use this!"
Does knowing and thinking about science make you good at other things in life?


4. Answering a question people care about
Does spending on education correlate to better scores and abilities of students?


5. Valuable to businesses
Does an aptitude for science make an employee more meticulous in their work? Or better at focusing on a task etc.?


6. What's the most popular?
Which branches of science are most profitable currently? 


7. Cost/Money rankings
Which branches of science cost the most to investigate? Which of those give us the most knowledge per dollar?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
It is not useful to know in everyday life.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018/chapter-2-understanding-and-interest-science-and-health

Hypothesis: Men are more likely to CLAIM they know more science than women. 
Question: Does knowledge of science vary by gender?
Topic: Level of Science Knowledge in People


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Are men more likely to claim to be knowledgable than woman for any field in which they know some amount of information?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Does knowledge of science vary by self classification of "extrovert" vs. "introvert." Or are those tags not useful here?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Level of Education. Are men or women more likely to 1. enroll at a university and then 2. onced enrolled, is one or the other more likely to graduate? And maybe of those who graduate, who is most likely to graduate first?

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

I'm leaning towards board games. But i'm worried about being able to procure sales data if that's what I end up being interested in. From what I've found, these companies tend to be a bit hush-hush on exact number of sales.
